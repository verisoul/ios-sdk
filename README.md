### Swift Package Manager (SPM)
To integrate VerisoulSDK using Swift Package Manager:

Open your project in Xcode.

Go to File > Add Packages.

Enter the repository URL for VerisoulSDK:
```swift
    https://github.com/verisoul/ios-sdk.git
```swift
Choose the version you wish to use and add the package.

The SDK will automatically integrate into your project.

### VerisoulSDK Class
VerisoulSDK provides the following public methods:

1. configure(env:projectId:bundleIdentifier:)
Configures the SDK with the environment, project ID, and bundle identifier. This initializes the networking, device check, and device attestation components.

Parameters:

env (VerisoulEnvironment): The environment to configure the SDK with (e.g., dev, staging, prod).
projectId (String): Your project's unique identifier.
bundleIdentifier (String): The app's bundle identifier.
```swift
    VerisoulSDK.shared.configure(env: .prod, projectId: "your-project-id", 
    bundleIdentifier: "com.example.app")
```swift
SDK Configuration: The configure(env:projectId:bundleIdentifier:) method should be called once, typically during the app's initialization process (e.g., in the AppDelegate or SceneDelegate)

2. session() async throws -> String
Retrieves the session ID asynchronously. Waits up to 10 seconds for the session ID from the web view.

Returns:
A string representing the session ID.
Throws:

An error if the session ID cannot be retrieved within the timeout.
```swift
do {
    let sessionId = try await VerisoulSDK.shared.session()
    print("Session ID: \(sessionId)")
} catch {
    print("Failed to retrieve session ID: \(error)")
}
```swift
